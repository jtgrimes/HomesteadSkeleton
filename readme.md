# HomesteadSkeleton

The purpose of this is to easily provide the [Laravel Homestead](https://github.com/laravel/homestead) Vagrant environment without having to rely on using the ```homestead``` command line application. Another use case would be if you do not have / do not want PHP locally installed on your system.

## Installation

Simply copy these files from this repo into your fresh Laravel application:

* scripts/
* aliases
* Homstead.yaml
* Vagrantfile

## Usage

See [Official Documentation](http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/homestead)
